# Boxes
Demonstrates custom UICollectionViewLayout

* Implements a CollectionView custom layout which wraps back and forth and allows you to toggle back and forth.
* Utilizes the rectangle to get the collectionViewAttributes for the particular item rather than precalculating it for the entire page. 
* Utilizes a Generic CollectionViewAdaptor which avoids the MegaViewController.
